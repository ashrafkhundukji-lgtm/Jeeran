-- ============================================================================
-- Give higher promotion-level shops an edge in the wallet geo-push: level is
-- now the PRIMARY sort key (an actual ranking advantage, not just a tiebreak),
-- ahead of bid_per_view and distance. This is what lets a shop that's driven
-- more real redemptions through Jeeran win the limited nearby-offer push
-- slots over a same-category competitor that's simply paying a higher bid.
--
-- Everything else about nearby_active_offers is unchanged — still
-- platform-wide, still ST_DWithin + business-only for MVP. See the original
-- definition/comments in 20260719_wallet_members_geo.sql.
